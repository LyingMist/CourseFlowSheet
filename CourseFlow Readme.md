## Background
After scanning through the UCSB gears and other schools' major flow charts. I find it difficulty to read the connection between the courses. How does each topics related to each other ?How does each course gets unlocked or unlocks other courses? I have this idea to represent all my courses I took (or is going to take) in a clean table to be easily visualized. I like the "linked list" idea from obsidian so I made this website to demonstrate
